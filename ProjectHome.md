This is a pack of shaders for old-school video game emulators. Copyrights are held by the respective authors.

Most of the shaders are converted from the work of their original authors, in order to make it work on GLES 2.0. Shader files are based on the higan XML shader format version 1.0, with slight changes and enhancements. We also make it into an apk file for distributing on Google Play, and making it available to different emulators.

Welcome contributing new shaders to the project!
